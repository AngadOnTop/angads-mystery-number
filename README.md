ðŸŽ® How to Play

Youâ€™ll see an animated welcome screen.

Pick a difficulty:

1. Easy â†’ 10 lives

2. Medium â†’ 5 lives

3. Hard â†’ 3 lives

Guess the number (1â€“100). The game will tell you if itâ€™s higher or lower.

You win if you guess correctly before you lose all your lives.

After each game, youâ€™ll be asked if you want to play again.

ðŸ”§ Internals & Logic

The player is fixed at the bottom row in the display grid.

A random number is generated at the start of each game.

Lives are decremented each wrong guess.

When guess matches the random number, you win.

If lives run out, game over.

On restart, the game resets state and displays the welcome/choice flow again.
